    Hysp keymap v1.0.1 - Corne RP2040
    Created by Alvaro Prieto Lauroba
    =============================================


    [ Features ]
     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    - Target user: person using macOS as their primary operating system and occasionally Windows.
    - Philosophy: Keyboard shortcuts are OS-independent, meaning they are translated into
      different key combinations depending on the selected OS mode (macOS by default).
    - Custom RGB implementation: visual notifications, themes, animations and reactive effects.
    - Custom modifier implementation with high customization capabilities.
    - Some keys have been relocated to improve ergonomics (85% QWERTY).
    - Custom communication between halves (master -> slave -> ack).
    - Hyper key: This key has been created to allow custom shortcuts depending on the active
      application. For example, Hyper + I could mean "italic" in Word, "indent" in a code editor,
      and "invert colours" in Photoshop. This type of behavior can be implemented with programs
      like Karabiner-Elements.


    [ Hardware ]
     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    [ Passwords ]

    - In macOS, split screen features achieved using BetterSnapTool, Rectangle, or similar tools
    - In Windows Unicode is managed using WinCompose, in macOs using custom key combos (to prevent Unicode Hex)
    - If you are facing problems in characters such as: ª, >, and others not outputing the expected value,
