    QMK TWEAKS
    =============================================
    - You will not be able to compile this source directly. It contains some QMK core tweaks.
      QMK version was released at december 2, 2020. Tweaks were applied in order to fix some
      tap dance issues and provide compatibility to Apple keyboards
    - Some files has been added to the \tweak folder. Use them as inspiration or directly replace
      them if you are using the same QMK version.
    - Required APPLE_FN_ENABLE, use this patch: https://gist.github.com/fauxpark/010dcf5d6377c3a71ac98ce37414c6c4
      (download the raw file, then run git apply <path-to-patch-file> in your qmk_firmware dir)
    - It is required a callback to detect when RGB is suspended, to do so, add this to rgb_matrix.c:
      __attribute__((weak)) void rgb_matrix_suspend_state_changed( bool suspend_state) {}
      and also, in the correct place inside of rgb_matrix_task:
      if(suspend_backlight != last_suspend_state){
        last_suspend_state = suspend_backlight;
        rgb_matrix_suspend_state_changed( suspend_backlight );
      }
    - Tap dance (TD) code has been fixed to allow multiple TD in a row without issues.
      Imagine you have some tap dance keys:
        > a => 1 a, 2 á
        > n => 1 n, 2 ñ
      Default implementation lead to problems if you try to write "ná", in the following scenario:
        > n down, a down, n up, a up, a down, a up  => naa
      The fix tries to solve this by detecting when a TD has been interrupted by other TD, and preventing
      the reset function call when the first TD is released. Modified code is related to the following variables:
        > interruption_first_td; interruption_second_td; last_td_release;
      Source code of process_tap_dance.c is included in \tweak folder
